        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Let them eat cake is a team of two Seattlites eating their way through the town. We met at University of Washington during our freshmen year so long ago. We quickly became great friends and started taking food journeys together. We would pick a random
          bus and hop on and see where it took us then ate and hopped on a returning bus back to campus.</p>

        <p>Hello lovely! I am a world traveler of sorts. I've lived in Seattle, Yokohama (Japan), Melbourne (Australia) and now I am currently living in Portland, the land of great coffee and doughnuts. While living overseas I got to travel around and have visited
          most of Asia long with a few random countries. I have a passion for diving the big blue and spending time learning new things...I recently got a sewing machine. </p>
